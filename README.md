# Project Notes

Owiin is a EAM program project (Enterprise Asset Management) derived from specific and extensive experience in the field, following the rules and best practice.

Owiin is at the same time a ready-to-use standard product, and a solution that can be custom-configured through provided mechanisms that allow to work on every system element (data models, workflows, reports, dashboards, connectors, etc.).

Please visit the project front page containing links for most of our resources: https://www.owiin.com/

You can have a first-hand experience about the software in one of our live cloud test site: https://www.owiin.com/test


# Credentials

Owiin is based on the ***iDempiere Business Suite***  from which it inherits the basic functionalities and the configuration mechanisms.
